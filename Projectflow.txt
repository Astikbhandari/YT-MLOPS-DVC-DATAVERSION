create git repo and clone it in local
create mycode.py file and code to it 
do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
if first time then pip install dvc
now we do dvc init(create .dvc gitignore, .dvc)
now do "mkdir s3" (creates a new s3 directory or file)
now we do " dvc remote add -d myremote s3 "
next "dvc add data/  " now you get error they said that this data file already tracked by git ,if you 
want to tracked by dvc then 1st you remove track by git now you write 1st " git rm -r --cached 'data' " 
2nd " git commit -m "stop tracking data" then you run "dvc add data/" then " git add .gitignore data.dvc "
